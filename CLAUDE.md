# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Status

No source code yet. An agile delivery plan for the project has been drafted at
`docs/agile-plan.md` — an auto-trade signal dashboard (React frontend, Java/Spring
Boot backend, Oracle Database via local Oracle XE, broker adapters starting with
Alpaca for stocks and Binance for crypto). It covers epics/features/user stories
(INVEST format) and the recommended subagent/skill usage for solo-driven
implementation. There are no build, lint, or test commands yet since no code has
been written.

When code is added to this repository, update this file with:
- Build, lint, and test commands (including how to run a single test)
- High-level architecture and project structure

## Mandatory workflow

Every change to the codebase, no matter how small, must:
1. Update this CLAUDE.md file to reflect the change (new commands, architecture shifts, updated status, etc.).
2. Be committed to git immediately after — do not batch multiple unrelated changes into one commit, and do not leave changes uncommitted.
3. Use a meaningful commit message that describes what actually changed and why — no generic messages like "update", "fix", or "changes".

This applies to every edit session: if files change, CLAUDE.md changes and a git commit follows in the same turn.
