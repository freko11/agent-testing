# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Status

E1-F1-S1 (local Oracle XE via Docker Compose) is done. `docker-compose.yml` runs
`gvenzl/oracle-xe:21-slim`, with credentials and host port sourced from `.env` (see
`.env.example` — never commit `.env`). Local data persists to `oracle-data/`
(gitignored). Connect from SQL Developer / `sqlplus` with:
- Host: `localhost`, Port: `1522` (not the default 1521 — this dev machine already
  runs a native Oracle listener on 1521, so the container's host port defaults to
  1522 via `ORACLE_HOST_PORT` in `.env`; override if your machine doesn't conflict)
- Service name: `XEPDB1`
- App user/password: `ORACLE_APP_USER` / `ORACLE_APP_USER_PASSWORD` from `.env`
- SYS password: `ORACLE_PASSWORD` from `.env` (SYSDBA role required for SYS)

Bring the DB up with `docker compose up -d`; first boot takes ~60-90s before the
healthcheck reports healthy (`docker compose ps`).

E1-F1-S2 (Spring Boot backend skeleton) is done. `backend/` is a Maven project
(Java 21, Spring Boot 4.1, package `com.autotrade.dashboard`) with `web`, `actuator`,
`data-jpa`, `validation` starters plus the `ojdbc11` Oracle driver. Run it with
`./mvnw spring-boot:run` from `backend/` (requires `ORACLE_APP_USER_PASSWORD` in the
environment, matching `.env`'s app-user password — Spring Boot reads env vars via
relaxed binding, no extra wiring needed). `/health` (actuator remapped to web
base-path `/`) returns 200 once the Oracle XE container from S1 is up, since the
datasource is already pointed at it (`jdbc:oracle:thin:@//localhost:${ORACLE_HOST_PORT:1522}/XEPDB1`)
— no JPA entities/repositories yet, that's F1.2. Build/test: `./mvnw verify`.

E1-F1-S3 (React app skeleton) is done. `frontend/` is a Vite + React 19 + TypeScript
app with `react-router-dom`, one placeholder route (`/` → `DashboardPage`). Run with
`npm install && npm run dev` from `frontend/`; build with `npm run build`.

E1-F1-S4 (CI pipeline) is done. `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs on every push and PR:
a `backend` job (`./mvnw -B verify`, Temurin 21) and a `frontend` job (`npm ci && npm run build`,
Node 22). Backend tests run against an in-memory H2 datasource
(`backend/src/test/resources/application.properties` overrides the main Oracle
datasource for the test classpath only) so CI and local `mvn verify` don't need Docker
or `.env` — Oracle is still what the running app uses in dev/paper/prod.
**Manual follow-up, still not done**: GitHub branch protection ("failure blocks merge")
requires a repo-settings change on `github.com/freko11/agent-testing`. Attempted via
`gh api .../branches/master/protection` (requiring the `backend`/`frontend` CI jobs as
status checks) and it was rejected: branch protection on `master` needs GitHub Pro/Team
or a public repo — this repo is private on the free plan, which doesn't support it.
Unblocks via either: upgrade the repo/org to a paid plan, or make the repo public, then
retry the same `gh api` call (or Settings → Branches manually). Deferred by user choice
for now.

E1-F1-S5 (env/config profiles) is done. Three Spring profiles in `backend/src/main/resources/`:
- `local` (default — activates automatically if `SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE` is unset):
  Docker Compose Oracle XE via `ORACLE_HOST_PORT`/`ORACLE_APP_USER`/`ORACLE_APP_USER_PASSWORD`.
- `paper`: reads `DB_URL`/`DB_USERNAME`/`DB_PASSWORD` (defaults fall back to the same
  local XE instance until a real paper-environment DB exists); this is also where E4's
  Alpaca-paper/Binance-testnet base URLs will be added.
- `prod`: same `DB_*` vars, no defaults — every value must come from the environment,
  so it can't silently start on placeholder config. Not usable until E6's live-mode
  gate exists.

Switch profiles via `SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=paper` (env var) or
`-Dspring-boot.run.profiles=paper` (mvnw) — no code changes needed; verified both
`local` (default) and `paper` bring the app up against the same Docker XE instance
using their respective env-var names.

This completes E1-F1 (local dev environment) — DB, backend, frontend, CI, and profiles
all in place. Next up per the plan's build sequence: E1-F1.2 (core data model), which
per the plan's own agent-role table warrants a `Plan` agent design gate before coding
(a real schema decision, not scaffolding).

Beyond that, no other source code yet. An agile delivery plan for the project has been drafted at
`docs/agile-plan.md` — an auto-trade signal dashboard (React frontend, Java/Spring
Boot backend, Oracle Database via local Oracle XE, broker adapters starting with
Alpaca for stocks and Binance for crypto). It covers epics/features/user stories
(INVEST format) and the recommended subagent/skill usage for solo-driven
implementation. The plan was expanded with stories closing gaps found in a review:
CI pipeline, DB migrations, app auth, a testing strategy, market-hours handling,
backtesting, adapter rate-limit/retry/outage handling, trade export, notifications,
a live-mode consent step, a portfolio-level exposure cap, rule-versioned audit
entries, and DB backup/restore. A consistency pass then fixed a stale story count,
extended the Plan-agent/`code-review` gates to cover E6's guardrail logic (not just
E4/E5), and flagged that E5's notification story softly depends on the stretch
watchlist feature. There are no build, lint, or test commands yet since no code has
been written.

Project-specific subagent definitions now live in `.claude/agents/` — `Plan.md`,
`Explore.md`, and `general-purpose.md` — customizing the three subagent roles the
agile plan calls for (design gate, research, background implementation) with this
project's domain specifics (Spring Boot/JPA/Oracle conventions, Alpaca/Binance order
semantics, the E2 rule-engine and E6 guardrail requirements). These override the
generic built-in agents of the same name for work done in this repo.

Project-specific skill definitions now live in `.claude/skills/`. Four amend
generic skills with this project's specifics — `run.md` (this stack's launch
sequence: Oracle XE via Docker Compose, Spring Boot backend, React frontend),
`dataviz.md` (Buy/Sell/Hold badge palette, stat tiles, candlestick+indicator
chart for E3), `simplify.md` (where premature abstraction is a real risk here —
adapters, rule engine — versus where a check that looks redundant is a
deliberate E6 safety net), and `security-review.md` (a checklist covering
broker-credential handling, the live-mode gate, and guardrail enforcement).
Three are new, non-generic project skills with no generic equivalent —
`signal-rule-review.md` (E2.3/E2.4 rule-table + backtest checklist),
`adapter-contract-check.md` (E4.1 BrokerAdapter conformance, retry/backoff,
idempotency), and `guardrail-check.md` (E6 risk-control verification before
the live-mode gate closes).

A repo-readiness audit (full directory inventory, cross-checked against
`docs/agile-plan.md`) confirmed the "no source code yet" status above is
accurate and found no gaps owned by an existing story except a few config-
hygiene items, now closed: a `.gitignore` was added (covering Java/Maven/
Gradle, Node, `.env*`, IDE files, and local Oracle data volumes, since E1's
skeleton stories are about to generate exactly what it excludes); the
backend-framework assumption in `docs/agile-plan.md` was confirmed as
**Spring Boot** (moved out of "assumptions" into a new "Confirmed decisions"
section, no objection raised); and F1.3-S1's acceptance criteria now
require a checked-in `.env.example` documenting every required config key
(broker keys, Oracle connection string) with no real values. The indicator-
library choice (`ta4j` vs. hand-rolled) and the ticker asset-type detection
rule remain intentionally open in `docs/agile-plan.md` — both are deferred
by design to when E2-F2 is actually picked up, not pre-build blockers. The
`fewer-permission-prompts` skill is worth running once E1 scaffolding
exists (not before — there's nothing to allowlist yet).

When code is added to this repository, update this file with:
- Build, lint, and test commands (including how to run a single test)
- High-level architecture and project structure

## Mandatory workflow

Every change to the codebase, no matter how small, must:
1. Update this CLAUDE.md file to reflect the change (new commands, architecture shifts, updated status, etc.).
2. Be committed to git immediately after — do not batch multiple unrelated changes into one commit, and do not leave changes uncommitted.
3. Use a meaningful commit message that describes what actually changed and why — no generic messages like "update", "fix", or "changes".

This applies to every edit session: if files change, CLAUDE.md changes and a git commit follows in the same turn.
